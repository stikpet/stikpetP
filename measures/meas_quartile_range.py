    Interquartile Range, Semi-Interquartile Range and Mid-Quartile Range
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Three different ranges that can be used with quartiles. The Interquartile Range (IQR) is simply the third minus the first quartile.
    
    The Semi-Interquartile range (a.k.a. Quartile Deviation) divides the IQR by 2.
    
    The Mid-Quartile Range adds the two quartiles and then divides by 2.
    
    A special case is the H-spread, which is if Hinges are used the IQR. This can be obtained by setting *method="tukey"*.
    
    The function uses the *me_quartiles* function and any of the methods from that function can be used.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : list or pandas series 
        the scores as numbers, or if text also provide levels
    levels : dictionary, optional 
        levels in order
    measure : {"iqr", "siqr", "qd", "mqr"}, optional 
        the specific measure to determine. Default is "iqr"
    method : string, optional 
        the method to use to determine the quartiles. See me_quartiles for options
    
    Returns
    -------
    A dataframe with:
    
    * *Q1*, the first (lower) quartile
    * *Q3*, the third (upper/higher) quartile
    * *range*, the measure determined
    
    Notes
    -----
    The formula used for the Interquartile Range is:
    $$IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$$
    
    This can be obtained by setting *range="iqr"*.
    
    The IQR is mentioned in Galton (1881, p. 245) and the H-spread in Tukey (1977, p. 44).
    
    The H-spread can be obtained by setting *range="iqr"* and *method="tukey"*.
    
    The formula used for the Semi-Interquartile Range (Quartile Deviation) is (Yule, 1911, p. 147):
    $$SIQR = \\frac{Q_3 - Q_1}{2}$$
    
    This can be obtained by setting *range="siqr"* or *range="qd"*.
    
    The formula for the mid-quartile range used is:
    $$MQR = \\frac{Q_3 + Q_1}{2}$$
    
    This can be obtained by setting *range="mqr"*.
    This formula can be found in Parzen (1980, p. 19), but there are probably older references.
