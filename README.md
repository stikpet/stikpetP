The goal of stikpetP is to provide functions for statistical analysis of
surveys. The functions are documented with the formulas and references
used.

The functions are NOT optimized but instead relatively easy to follow.
If you would look at the source code it is most often a combination of
if statements and for loops.

## Installation

You can install the development version of stikpetP from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` python
!pip install -https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stikpet/stikpetP/main/stikpetP.tar.gz
import stikpetP as ps
```
